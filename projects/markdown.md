# Using Markdown

Go to <https://dillinger.io>.

After the splash screen, you will see two columns, on the left and on the right. 

You can type in the left, and see the results in the right.

What you type on the left is a code called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This is a simple way of typing plain-text that a computer can turn into formatted, attractive text, including images and links.

You can use Markdown to produce a Paleography Notebook for Catullus 1.

### Set Up

Click on the left-hand column and select all the text that is there. 

Delete it.

Copy the text below and paste it into the left-hand column.
