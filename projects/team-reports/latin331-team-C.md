## 360 Alta tepefaciet permista flumina caede:

- Alternate spelling: "permista" vs. "permixta"

## 361 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

![image1](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1068,0.1492,0.3792,0.02593&wID=500&CVT=JPEG)

- This line is red every time it occurs in this selection of the manuscript.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.06849,0.5867,0.07094,0.04207&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- This symbol repeats with every recurrence of "currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi."
- It is likely that another scribe added these in at a later time because they are a different ink color than the rest of the manuscript colors (brown and red)

## 362 Denique testis erit morti quoque reddita praeda:

## 363 Quom terrae excelso coaceruatum aggere bustum,

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1032,0.2143,0.07110,0.03339&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- archaism: "Quom" is the archaic spelling of "cum"
- The oldest form of cum is quom. Quum came after quom, and then the 'qu' turned into a 'c' to become cum. This is called assimilation.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1778,0.2147,0.06360,0.02654&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- genitive
- "terrae" means "of the Earth"
- Compare to Thompson's edition "teres" which means "round."
- It is interesting that both interpretations make sense within the context of the sentence. 

## 364 Excipiet niveos percussae virginis artus.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2378,0.2107,0.07518,0.02862&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2684,0.2430,0.1034,0.02862&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

Handwriting issue: 
- Compare percussae to excelso in the previous line.
- While it is possible that the scribe meant perculsae rather than percussae, the juxtaposition of the 'ls' in excelso does not resemble the 'ss' in percussae; for this reason, we are recognizing this word as percussae.
- Percussae is an entirely different word than perculsae (which is seen in the O manuscript family). Percussae comes from "percutio," which means 'to strike through' and perculsae comes from "percello" which means 'to beat down.'

## 366 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.06882,0.2730,0.4715,0.06544&wID=500&CVT=JPEG)

- The scribe mixed up lines 365 and 366, so rather than rewriting the page from the beginning, they added the letters "a" and "b" in red to show they mixed up the order.
- The scribe likely realized this upon completing line 366, because the letters are in the same red ink.

## 365 Nam simul ac fessis dederit sors copia Achivis,

## 367 Urbis Dardaniae Neptunia solvere tecta,

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2741,0.3410,0.08594,0.02666&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- The only word the scribe capitalized in the entire selection is "Neptunia"...The scribe refers to "Polyxenia" in 368, but her name is not capitalized. It is possible this represents a reverence for the gods, because Neptune is a god and Polyxenia is a girl. 
- Additional evidence of this is seen in the first few lines of Catullus 64 because Neptune is capitalized in line 2, but the names of peoples (argivae, line 4) and places (fines aeetheios, line 3) are not. However, Peleus and Thetis are capitalized, so it is hard to say exactly what the scribe was thinking. Perhaps the capitalization of Peleus and Thetis shows that he sees them as god-like, if not as actual gods.

## 368 Alta Polyxenia madefient caede sepulchra.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.4232,0.3710,0.1060,0.02972&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)


- Alternate spelling: "sepulchra" vs. "sepulcra"

## 369 Quae velut ancipiti succumbens victima ferro,

## 370 Proiiciet truncum submisso poplite corpus:

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1044,0.4391,0.09475,0.03168&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- Spelling error, likely copied from manuscript G: manuscript G wrote "proiciet" as "proiiciet"
- Bodmer 47 scribe made the same error.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2792,0.4351,0.08725,0.03376&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- archaism: submisso vs. summiso
- Submisso became summiso when the 'bm' in became assimilated into the 'mm'
- Manuscripts in the G family seem to favor the archaic version, submisso (O uses summiso)
-  G has an abbreviated form of submisso (sūmisso) in line 370, while O just has sumisso with no symbol showing it is an abbreviation. This is because the ‘bm’ in submisso became assimilated into ‘mm’ and the word became summisso. The sumisso spelling in O that he noted in ap. crit. is a misspelled version of the more archaic submisso that is seen in Bodmer 47 and G. This also supports the idea that O came from a different source than the rest of the manuscripts we looked at because it has the same spelling ‘sumisso’ as O.

## 371 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

## 372 Quare agite optatos animis coniungere amores:

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.3787,0.4930,0.1029,0.04195&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- abbreviated form of infinitive "coniungere"
- the symbol above the u means to add an n

## 373 Accipiat coniurx foelici foedere divam.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2022,0.5322,0.08594,0.03107&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- Spelling error, "coniurx" should be "coniunx"

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2810,0.5322,0.1376,0.03107&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- Spelling error: "foelici" should be "felici"
- This spelling error is interesting because the next word is "foedere," which means he mixed up the vowels in felici, foelici, and foedere.
- We think that the scribe may have been mindlessly copying the words. He probably looked ahead at foedere and accidentally added an o to felici. The incunabulum does not make this same error, so it is definitely a scribal mistake.

## 374 Dedatur cupido iam dudum nupta marito.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.3118,0.5626,0.05757,0.02752&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- abbreviated form of "dudum"
- the symbol above the u means to add an m

## 375 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

## 376 Non illam nutrix orienti luce revisens,

## 377 Hesterno coluum poterit circundare filo.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2004,0.6629,0.06751,0.02483&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- Thompson has this word as "collum" which means "neck"
- Bodmer 47, however, has coluum, which means "distaff" in the gentive plural case
- This is still relevant to the passage because it is talking about thread and spindles. It is unclear whether the scribe got lazy with the second 'l' or or if he meant to put an entirely different word. 

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.3392,0.6602,0.1053,0.03143&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- Alternate spelling: "circundare" vs. "circumdare"

## 378 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

## 379 Anxia nec mater discordit moesta puellae.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.3844,0.7205,0.07387,0.02838&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)

- archaism: "moesta" is the more archaic form of "maesta"

## General Notes

- Compare the handwriting in lines 373, 376, and 379.
- Notice the 'nx' in coniunx, the 'ix' in nutrix, and the 'nx' in anxia.
- The way the 'nx' looks in anxia makes it likely that the coniunx in 373 is misspelled, with the scribe actually writing coniurx in the manuscript. Coniunx and nutrix look more similar than coniunx and anxia.
- We think the scribe might have gotten lazy by the time he got to line 373's coniunx because he blended the n and the x together, making it look like it is an rx.
- He might have taken a break before writing 379 because the nx is very clear in anxia compared to coniunx.

- Handwriting note: When e's occur at the end of the word, they have flourishes

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.4459,0.1489,0.1566,0.02605&wID=600&CVT=JPEG)

- The scribe used lines to write in stright lines
- there are horizontal lines drawn under each line of poetry and vertical lines drawn at the beginning and end of each line.

![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1042,0.4724,0.4555,0.08721&wID=500&CVT=JPEG)

- The scribe uses a lot of punctuation.
- In particular, he often uses periods, commas, and colons after each line.

## Translation

He will warm the deep river with blood having been mixed in:

Run spindles, run leading the cross-threads.

And then the plunder also returned for death will be a witness:

When the mound was heaped up with a lofty pile of the earth,

It will draw out the snowy limbs of the virgin having been struck through.

Run spindles, run leading the cross-threads. 

For as soon as chance will have given the tired Greeks the opportunity,

To loosen the Neptunian roofs of the Dardanian city,

The deep tombs will become wet with the blood of Polyxenia, 

Who, just as a victim succumbing to the two-headed sword,

She will throw forth her headless corpse onto the knee having been collapsed:

Run spindles, run leading the cross-threads.

Therefore come to unite the hoped-for love to the mind.

May the husband receive the goddess in happy agreement,

May the bride be given to her eager husband now after so long.

Run spindles, run leading the cross-threads.

The wet nurse returning to her with the rising light,

Will not be able to encircle with yesterday's thread of the distaff,

Run spindles, run leading the cross-threads.

Nor will the anxious sad mother of the girl quarrel.

## Manuscript Comparisons

- We put all the differences we observed in the manuscripts in parentheses next to the word that changed between our manuscript and the manuscript in question.
- Note: Bodmer 47 is the newest out of all the manuscripts we compared it to, making it the most "compromised" copy of Catullus 64 it this group.
- abbreviations are noted ab.
- All the manuscripts except O (and Thompson) seem to come from the same manuscript family.

### Thompson's Edition
373 Accipiat coniurx (coniunx) foelici (felici) foedere divam (punctuation change from . to ,)

374 Dedatur cupido iam dudum nupta marito.

375 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi. 
- based on the apparatus criticus, (378 (=375)) Thompson places 378 here in his edition, which means he combines the repeated lines 375 and 378...however, he later adds one of these repetitions to 381. At first we thought he simply moved 378 to 381, but his note in the apparatus criticus says otherwise. This is very interesting.


376 Non illam nutrix orienti luce revisens

377 Hesterno coluum (collum) poterit circundare (circumdare) filo (punctuation change from . to ,)

(378 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi. is placed here in Bodmer 47)

379 Anxia nec mater discordit (discordis) moesta (maesta) puellae. (punctuation change, Thompson gets rid of period)

380 subcubito caros mittet sperare nepotes (this is not part of our selection, it is just interesting to note his line number changes)

381 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi. (see note after 375)	

Notes:
 - There are several punctuation changes in Thompson’s edition compared to our manuscript
- Thompson typically uses the newer forms of the words, Bodmer 47 used more archaic forms.
 - There is a grammatical change in line 379, he changes discordit in Bodmer 47 to discordis.
 - Thompson's edition takes more after the Bodleian manuscript than the others. In general, he follows O's word and spelling variants.
 - While Thompson usually follows the Bodleian manuscript, it is missing several lines. He adds these lines back into his edition (379 and 380)
 
Other Differences We Noticed Not Shown Above:
- The translation of 372: 'Therefore come to unite the hoped-for love to the mind' (Bodmer 47) is awkward compared to Thompson’s edition, which translates as 'therefore come unite the hoped-for love of the mind.' (There is a grammatical switch from animis in Bodmer 47 to animi in Thompson, the word goes from genitive to dative.)
- In line 363, Bodmer 47 has the word terrae, which means ‘of the Earth’. Thompson, however, has teres, which means ‘round’. The sentence still makes sense despite this switch.
- In line 367, Bodmer 47 has the word tecta, which means ‘roof’. Thompson has vincla, which means ‘chains’. The sentence still makes sense despite this switch.

### Thompson's Apparatus Criticus

377 hesterno γ: esterno O, externo GR
- Since Bodmer 47 comes from manuscript G, there has been a change here.
- The incunabulum changes G’s externo to hesterno in his manuscript and since Bodmer 47 comes from the same manuscript family, Bodmer 47 has the same change to hesterno)

378 (=375) ut spurium secl. Bergk, alii
- Thompson combines lines 375 and 378 and switches the original line numbers
- There is an unaccounted for line in 381 since he is saying that 375 = 378)

379-81 om. O

Accipiat coniurx (ab. cuīx - coniunx, spelling error) foelici (felici) foedere (ab. fedē - fedem) divam

Dedatur cupido iam dudum (ab. dudū in Bodmer 47. Not ab. here) nupta marito (ab. māito - marito)

Currite ducentes subtegmina (ab. sb’tegmina - subtegmina) currite fusi

Non (ab. Nō - non) illam (ab. illā - illam) nutrix (ab. nut’x - nutrix) orienti luce revisens (ab. revisēs - revisens)

Hesterno (ab. Est’no - Hesterno) coluum (ab. collū - collum) poterit circundare (ab. c’cumdāe - circumdare) filo

Currite ducentes (ab. ducētes - ducentes) subtegmina (ab. sb’tegmina - subtegmina) currite fusi

Anxia nec mater discordit moesta puellae (not included at all in this manuscript, scribe gaps lines 379 and 380 and goes straight to talia...)

Notes:
- This is the oldest manuscript we looked at.
- There is no punctuation, and there are a lot of abbreviations. This is typical of the older manuscripts - the more contemporary ones usually have punctuation and unabbreviated words.
- O is the most different from the rest of the manuscripts we looked at. They seem to be in one manuscript family originating in G. O is the outlier.
- Lines 379 and 380 in Bodmer 47 are not in O. The other manuscripts we looked at have these lines, which supports the fact that O is the most different.

### Paris 14137 (G) folio 26v Manuscript (1375)
Accipiat coniurx (ab. coniūx - coniunx) foelici (felici) foedere (federe) divam.

Dedatur cupido iam dudum (ab. dudu in Bodmer 47. Not ab. here) nupta marito.

Currite ducentes subtegmina (sub tegmina) currite fusi.

Non illam nutrix orienti luce revisens

Hesterno (Externo) coluum (collum) poterit circundare (ab. circūdare - circumdare) filo.

Currite ducentes subtegmina (sub tegmina) currite (ab. curīte - currite) fusi.

Anxia nec mater discordit (discordis) moesta (mesta) puellae (puelle). (more spelling errors in this line, perhaps his hand got tired?)

Notes:
- after O, second oldest manuscript
- This manuscript is kind of a bridge between the old and new traditions. It has abbreviations, which is more characteristic of older manuscripts, and punctuation, which is more characteristic of newer manuscripts.
- It has less abbreviations than the Bodleian manuscript. 

### Incunabulum Catulli Carmina cum comm. Antonii Parthenii, Image 71 and 72 (1487)

Accipiat coniurx (coniunx) foelici (felici) foedere divam.

Dedatur cupido iam dudum nupta marito.

Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi. (punctuation difference, :)

Non illam nutrix orienti luce revisens,

Hesterno coluum poterit circundare filo.

Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi (punctuation difference, :)

Anxia nec mater discordit (discordis) moesta puellae.

Notes:
- This manuscript is an incunabulum. An incunabulum is a printed edition, NOT a manuscript (not written by hand)
- Bodmer 47 likely copied from this incunabulum because they share a lot of the same spellings, and they both have punctuation. 
- Bodmer 47 was created 1495, 8 years after this manuscript. 
- Both Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum probably copied from G because they have similar spellings of proiiciet in line 370. 
- G is the oldest of the three manuscripts. It seems like Incunabulum printer expanded all the abbreviations seen in G
- Bodmer 47 has the least abbreviations of all the manuscripts.
- 

#### Evidence that Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum copied from the same source: 
Variants:
- terrae vs. teres 
- coluum vs. collum
- perculsae vs. percussae
- Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum are in agreement; they both use the words on the left

Alternate Spellings:
- permista vs. permixta
- sepulchra vs. sepulcra
- circundare vs. circumdare
- Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum are in agreement; they both use the words on the left
- Latin spelling was not really standardized by this point, which is why alternate spellings exist. The fact that both Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum have the same alternate spellings means it is more than likely they copied from the same source.

Archaisms:
- quom - quum - cum: this is the only difference between Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum. Bodmer 47 uses "quom" which is the most archaic form of cum. However, the incunabulum, which is older, uses "quum." It is odd that the newer manuscript uses the older form of cum...this likely happened because the spelling was not standardized
- moesta vs. maesta
- submisso vs. summisso
- Apart from quom/quum, Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum are in agreement; they both use the words on the left.

Because of the similarities between Bodmer 47 and the Incunabulum, we can conclude that they were contemporaries. Thus, they are part of the same manuscript family/network. They either copied from the same source or Bodmer 47 copied from Incunabulum (simply because Bodmer 47 is 8 years younger than the Incunabulum).
