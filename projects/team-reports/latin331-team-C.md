( urn:cts:latinLit:phi0472.phi001:64.1-64.7 )

[All observations in context](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:fufolio:bodlian30.2019a:bodlian30_47@0.2544,0.2495,0.05562,0.02489&urn=urn:cite2:fufolio:bodlian30.2019a:bodlian30_47@0.3037,0.2462,0.06509,0.02884)

## 360 Alta tepefaciet permista flumina caede:

Spelling error: "permista" should be "permixta"
## 361 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

This line is red every time it occurs in this selection of the manuscript.

This symbol repeats with every recurrence of "currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi." It is likely that another scribe added these in at a later time because they are a different ink color than the rest of the manuscript colors (brown and red)
## 362 Denique testis erit morti quoque reddita praeda:

## 363 Quom terrae excelso coaceruatum aggere bustum,

"Quom" is the archaic spelling of "cum"
## 364 Excipiet niveos percussae virginis artus.

Handwriting issue: Compare percussae to excelso in the previous line. While it is possible that the scribe meant perculsae rather than percussae, the juxtaposition of the 'ls' in excelso does not resemble the 'ss' in percussae; for this reason, we are recognizing this word as percussae.
## 366 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.06882,0.2730,0.4715,0.06544&wID=500&CVT=JPEG)
The scribe mixed up lines 365 and 366, so rather than rewriting the page from the beginning, they added the letters "a" and "b" in red to show they mixed up the order. The scribe likely realized this upon completing line 366, because the letters are in the same red ink.
## 365 Nam simul ac fessis dederit sors copia Achivis,

## 367 Urbis Dardaniae Neptunia solvere tecta,
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2741,0.3410,0.08594,0.02666&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
The only word the scribe capitalized in the entire selection is "Neptunia"...The scribe refers to "Polyxenia" in 368, but her name is not capitalized. It is possible this represents a reverence for the gods, because Neptune is a god and Polyxenia is a girl.
## 368 Alta Polyxenia madefient caede sepulchra.
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.4232,0.3710,0.1060,0.02972&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
Spelling error: "sepulchra" should be "sepulcra"
## 369 Quae velut ancipiti succumbens victima ferro,

## 370 Proiiciet truncum submisso poplite corpus:
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.1044,0.4391,0.09475,0.03168&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
Spelling error, likely copied from manuscript G: manuscript G wrote "proiciet" as "proiiciet" and the Bodmer 47 scribe made the same error.
## 371 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

# 372 Quare agite optatos animis coniungere amores:

## 373 Accipiat coniurx foelici foedere divam.
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2022,0.5322,0.08594,0.03107&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
Spelling error, "coniurx" should be "coniunx"
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2810,0.5322,0.1376,0.03107&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
Spelling error: "foelici" should be "felici." This spelling error is interesting because the next word is "foedere," which means he mixed up the vowels in felici, foelici, and foedere.
## 374 Dedatur cupido iam dudum nupta marito.

## 375 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

## 376 Non illam nutrix orienti luce revisens,

## 377 Hesterno coluum poterit circundare filo.

Spelling error: "coluum" should be "collum"
![image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/fufolio/codbod47/2019a/bod47_89_43r_0.tif&RGN=0.2004,0.6629,0.06751,0.02483&wID=250&CVT=JPEG)
Spelling error: "circundare" should be "circumdare"
## 378 Currite ducentes subtegmina currite fusi.

## 379 Anxia nec mater discordit moesta puellae.

Spelling error: "moesta" should be "maesta"

Compare the handwriting in lines 373, 376, and 379. Compare the 'nx' in coniunx, the 'ix' in nutrix, and the 'nx' in anxia. The way the 'nx' looks in anxia makes it likely that the coniunx in 373 is misspelled, with the scribe actually writing coniurx in the manuscript. Coniunx and nutrix look more similar than coniunx and anxia.

Handwriting note: When e's occur at the end of the word, they have flourishes
