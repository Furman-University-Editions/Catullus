## Instructions

1.	**November 21 meeting:** See above for your team assignments and links to the images of the manuscripts you will be analyzing. Introduction to image citation tool. 

	- As you draw rectangles around your text, grab the source address and stick it in a separate document throughout the entire transcription process (see next step).
	- Dr. Blackwell and I will be available for extra help on this portion of the assignment during lab hours (tbd).
	- **Open [this link](https://github.com/Furman-University-Editions/Catullus/blob/master/projects/markdown.md) to see instructions for setting up a document for recording observations.**

2.	Make a diplomatic transcription of the text in a separate document. This essentially means writing down the letters you see. Use sub-linear dots to indicate letters you are not certain of. Use square brackets to indicate any holes or gaps in the manuscript or if the beginning or ends of lines are incomplete.   

	- This can be handwritten (neatly) or typed. Make sure to double-space.

3.	Make an edition of the text and make (some) sense of what you have written down in a separate document. Start with word division. Put in spaces before and after words you recognize. Put in punctuation where you see fit. If you have an idea of what letters or words may have appeared in parts of the text that have holes in them or have incomplete line beginnings or endings, suggest supplements.

	- This can be handwritten (neatly) or typed. Make sure to double-space.

4.	Translate your text into good English while remaining true to the grammar of the Latin and true to the verse alignment (as much as is possible). Do not copy from a published translation.

	- This can be handwritten (neatly) or typed. Make sure to double-space.

5.	Observe, note down, and analyze the manuscript for unique qualities that would be difficult to reflect in a translation. These could include drawings on the page, marginalia, ambiguous text, the handwriting, “mistakes” or “misspellings,” and other grammatical marks, etc. Consider what your observations of the manuscript itself can tell us about the scribal process and the textual tradition of Catullus. What does this manuscript contribute to our knowledge?

	- These observations and analyses of the manuscript should be typed. Be sure to include relevant images of the text in support of your paper.

6.	Choose about 5-10 lines of text within your manuscript pages to compare with other manuscripts. Note down any variations from the other versions of the text you have and evaluate these differences. Compare your edition of the manuscript to the apparatus criticus (ap. crit.) in Thomson’s edition. Read, understand, be able to ‘decipher’ the ap. crit. of your text in Thomson’s edition. Work through the ap. crit. of a specific passage; compare and contrast key critical editions; identify larger textual critical issues; account for readings of particular words or lines. Try to understand the rationale behind the particular editorial decisions represented in your section of the ap. crit. Be ready to draw brief attention to two or three points of interest or controversy, as you see them. 

	- This comparative analysis should be typed.

7.	**December 3 meeting:** Explanation of presentation guidelines. The presentations are an opportunity for students to illustrate their final findings with images of specific stuff in the manuscripts. Each team should have a title for their presentation, and should incorporate images of their manuscript into the presentation.

8.	Mock presentations between December 9 and 12. Each team will do a run-through of their talk and will receive suggestions for improvement in preparation of the final presentation.

9.	Present your findings during the final examination period (about 15 mins). The presentation period will be Friday, December 13 at 12-2:30pm.

10.	After the presentations, each team should submit hardcopies of the following documents: 

	a. Source addresses
	b. Diplomatic transcription
	c. Edition
	d. English translation
	e. Manuscript analysis
	f. Comparative analysis
